     *  - We need something to hold the various poperties of how the camera moves
     *  - may or may not have anything to do with an object.
     *  - 3 methods that return cam position and cam look at

     * 
     * What would a ViewManager do?
     * What would ViewProfile do
     * What does camera do?
     * 
     * Game needs to know about camera modes. Camera manager could handle with that.
     * CameraManager could allow multiple cameras to be added, with an id.
     * SpecificCameras could be overridden classes from a base camera
     * SpecificCamera is where the custom logic goes.
     * You can tell the camera manager which camera to use
     * you can tell the camera manager which object to watch
     * 
     * Degree of freedom
     *  Different cam types / with different attributes per object
     *  
     * 
     * How will the watch camera know which object to watch?
     * Base camera could have a list of Gobjects.
     * Camera controls
